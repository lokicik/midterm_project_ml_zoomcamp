### **Project Presentation**
I would like to introduce my most comprehensive project to date! I have completed the project "Drinking or Smoking Classification" which I developed as the Midterm Project during the 7th week of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp organized by DataTalksClub and presented by Alexey Grigorev. I had the opportunity to apply all the techniques I learned, and I gave my all to this project. I look forward to your feedback and hope for positive reviews!
### **Problem Description**
Besides regular users of smoke and alcohol, passive smokers and non-regular drinkers are getting their body hurt aswell. This project can be used to determine if a passive smoker or a non-regular drinker doing how much damage to their body and know about if they are smoking or drinking as much as a regular users, so they can lower their usage of drinking or smoking. This project also can be used to determine if a child is smoking or drinking, his/her body is affected by the smokers or drinkers around him/her or not.
### **Problem Solution**
I've used the dataset to develop 2 different models, one for Alcohol Drinking Prediction, and one for Smoking Prediction. The reason I did this is so that the user can input a single record and get the results from both models, drinking and smoking probability. The target variable for the drinking model is "DRK_YN",  for the smoking model it's "SMK_stat_type_cd". I've  extracted the target variables from the dataset and trained models separately. The Smoking Model is a multiclass -can be binary if predictions for 0 and 1 is summarized in prediction 0, which would mean not drinker, and 1 stays 1 which already stands for drinker- classification model which predicts 0/1/2 (never smoked/smoked but quit/smoker). The Drinking Model is a binary classification model which predicts 0/1(drinker/not drinker).

### **Dataset**
This dataset is collected from National Health Insurance Service in Korea. All personal information and sensitive data were excluded.
The purpose of this dataset is to:

*   Analysis of body signal
*   Classification of smoker or drinker

*   weight	[kg]
*   sight_left	eyesight(left)
*   sight_right	eyesight(right)
*   hear_left	hearing left, 1(normal), 2(abnormal)
*   hear_right	hearing right, 1(normal), 2(abnormal)
*   SBP	Systolic blood pressure[mmHg]
*   DBP	Diastolic blood pressure[mmHg]
*   BLDS	BLDS or FSG(fasting blood glucose)[mg/dL]
*   tot_chole	total cholesterol[mg/dL]
*   HDL_chole	HDL cholesterol[mg/dL]
*   LDL_chole	LDL cholesterol[mg/dL]
*   triglyceride	triglyceride[mg/dL]
*   hemoglobin	hemoglobin[g/dL]
*   urine_protein	protein in urine, 1(-), 2(+/-), 3(+1), 4(+2), 5(+3), 6(+4)

*   SGOT_ALT	ALT(Alanine transaminase)[IU/L]
*   gamma_GTP	y-glutamyl transpeptidase[IU/L]

*   SMK_stat_type_cd	Smoking state, 1(never), 2(used to smoke but quit), 3(still smoke)

### **Midterm Project Requirements (Evaluation Criteria)**

* Problem description
* EDA
* Model training
* Exporting notebook to script
* Model deployment
* Reproducibility
* Dependency and environment management
* Containerization
* Cloud deployment


### **Dependency and environment management guide**

``pip install pipenv``

``pip shell``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``


### **Containerization**
1-)``docker tag image_name YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/image_name``
![docker1](https://github.com/lokicik/midterm_project_ml_zoomcamp/assets/65876412/d2303b74-b71d-45f9-9d2d-e03ec7b1cc1c)


2-)``docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/image_name``
![docker2](https://github.com/lokicik/midterm_project_ml_zoomcamp/assets/65876412/a0bafe9c-24bd-484e-9111-36926d1007ed)

### **Deployment guide**
#### **To run it locally:**

* Run ``python predict.py`` on a terminal

* Open a new terminal and run python ``predict_docker.py``

#### **To run it on docker:**

* Open a terminal

* ``docker build -t midterm_project .``

* ``docker run -it --rm -p 7860:7860 midterm_project``

* Open a new terminal and run ``python predict_docker.py``

#### **To run it on cloud:**

* Push your image to docker hub like in the Containerization section

* Open https://render.com/ and create a web service

* Select "Deploy an existing image from a registry"
